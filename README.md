## Ethical purchasing groups

Ethical purchasing groups are an Italian-based system of purchasing goods collectively. These groups, known in Italian as Gruppi di Acquisto Solidale, are usually set up by a number of consumers who cooperate in order to buy food and other commonly used goods directly from producers at a price that is fair to both parties.

An ethical purchasing group does not simply aim to get the cheapest price, but puts people and the environment before profit. An ethical purchasing group chooses products and producers on the basis of respect for the environment and of solidarity between the members of the group, the traders and the producers. These criteria generally lead to the choice of local products in order to minimize the environmental impact of transport, fair-trade goods, in order to respect disadvantaged producers by promoting their human rights, and reusable or eco-compatible goods, to promote a sustainable lifestyle.
